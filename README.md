# Expense-Tracker-App
Expense Tracker App with React Native

This is my first React-Native App.

This app will help a user save and tag expenses on a remote server using a REST API.
I am going to use React Native with Expo.

The app will have following screens:
1-Signup
2-Login
3-Splash
4-Main
5-FullExpenseDetails
6-SelectedExpenseDetails
